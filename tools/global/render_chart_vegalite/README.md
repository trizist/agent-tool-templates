# Render Vega-Lite Chart Tool

This tool is designed to generate Vega-Lite charts based on the dataset from the AI catalog. 

For implementation details, please refer to the [custom_model](./custom_model) directory and `custom.py` file.


## How to call the tool
To call or invoke the tool, send a properly formatted JSON request to the deployed model’s prediction endpoint in DataRobot using its API; the model processes your input and returns a prediction or summary. This can be done programmatically via scripts, command-line tools like `curl`, or integrated into applications.

Please refer to the [making predictions](../README.md#making-predictions) section of documentation for global tools for more technical details on how to call the tool.

### Input structure
When invoking the tool, provide a JSON request as input. The JSON request must include a top-level `payload` object. All parameters listed below should be placed inside this payload object, which will be forwarded to the tool.

**Payload parameters**:
- `vegalite_spec` (string): The Vega-Lite JSON specification, serialized as a string. This specification defines the chart to be rendered. If the `data` field contains an AI Catalog `dataset_id`, the tool will automatically fetch the dataset and generate the chart.  

Example:

```json
{
    "payload": {
        "vegalite_spec": "{\"$schema\": \"https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json\", \"description\": \"A simple point chart for the IRIS dataset\", \"data\": \"683ee07e7e96db41ab02b263\", \"mark\": {\"type\": \"point\"}, \"encoding\": {\"x\": {\"field\": \"sepal length (cm)\", \"type\": \"quantitative\"}, \"y\": {\"field\": \"sepal width (cm)\", \"type\": \"quantitative\"}, \"color\": {\"field\": \"species\", \"type\": \"nominal\"}}, \"width\": 400, \"height\": 300}"
    }
}
```

### Output structure
The output will be a JSON response with the result containing a base64-encoded image of the chart, wrapped in the markup.

```json
{
  "result": "<imageb64>...base64-encoded contents of the chart image...</imageb64>" 
}
```
